#### Project Dependencies

- MongoDB - <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/">Install Here</a>
- Java 8 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Install Here</a>
- JUnit 4.+ <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/getting-started">Install Here</a>

After importing the project into Eclipse, navigate to the "Project Properties" and then to Java libraries. Next, click on "Add External Jars," and within the project root directory is a folder labeled "jars" which contains all the mongo drivers to connect and make query in Java. Import the following:

- bson-3.6.3.jar
- mongodb-driver-3.6.3.jar
- mongodb-driver-core-3.6.3.jar

Once those three Jars have been included, the project is ready to run the client and JUnit tests. The UML diagram is located <a href="https://github.com/johnosullivan/AOOP/blob/master/AOOP.png">Here.</a>
